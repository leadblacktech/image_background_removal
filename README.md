# Automated Image Background Removal Tool

## Introduction

This tool, a refined clone of an existing repository, comes equipped with a **watchdog** feature. It diligently monitors a designated folder for images, triggering automatic background removal processes upon detection.

## Motivation

My passion for **Photogrammetry** involves capturing hundreds of images, each demanding meticulous background editing. This task, while crucial, can be time-consuming. Hence, I sought a solution that not only retains the original functionality but also specifically targets a folder for continuous monitoring.

## The Workflow

1. **Capture the Essential Images:** Begin by taking all the required pictures for your project.
2. **Transfer to the Monitored Folder:** Simply pass these images to the designated monitored folder.
3. **Automated Processing:** The system then springs into action, processing each image to seamlessly remove backgrounds, regardless of their varying nature.

## The Advantage

This streamlined workflow significantly frees up time, allowing me to focus on other critical aspects of 3D object creation. The final touch involves employing **Adobe Photoshop** and **Adobe Lightroom**, adding that professional finish to the images.

Embracing this automated approach transforms a traditionally labor-intensive process into a swift, efficient, and more enjoyable part of my creative hobby.
